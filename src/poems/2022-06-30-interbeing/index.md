Are we individuals?  
As we learn too look inside  
And see the causes that led to us

Plants helping you breathe, the Sun making you see  
Every object you handle touched by thousands  
Everything we consume manifested by countless others  
The whole world working together to keep you from falling apart

Welcome to the new world  
The new story  
Where we can trace every atom of our selves, every glitch in the world,  
back to another  
Every particle begging to be explored and tracked down

Itâ€™s the joy of discovering consequence  
An innocent world lost  
A real world at our feet

It turns out we are always divided infinitely
