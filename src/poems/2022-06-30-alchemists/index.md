Straight out of the womb, six doors open  
Reality flows in and sticks to us

Earth, air, water, fire  
Weighing, moving, binding, burning  
The stream of life pouring over us  
Helpless consciousness

But then the sense-making starts  
We learn to wield  
Knead the clay  
Interpret the wind  
Swim in the river  
Control the temperature

Out of the elements  
We start crafting a life  
We are all alchemists
