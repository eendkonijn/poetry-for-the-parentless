We came into the world  
and were orphaned by a force unknown  
a force that swept us into creation

We found the path  
in stones and symbols  
crumbled, decaying

On the ruins we built  
at the whims of those we did not know  
those behind the light

we convinced ourselves we wanted this  
but like our fathers and mothers  
again we were not free

how could we have known?

we are the parentless  
our liberation  
is one from fiction  
from the consciousness that makes us prisoner of our own minds

how could we have known?

we are the parentless  
orphaned by the light

on the ruins  
of stones and symbols  
we will build the new
