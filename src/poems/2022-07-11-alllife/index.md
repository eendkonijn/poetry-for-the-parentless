All life  
A prayer of form and color  
Wriggling, wobbling, branches, branching,  
Grooves, lines, nature writes,

Every creature that comes into birth  
Every being a wild expression of celebratory ecstacy

Life wants to live.

Growing, mating, seeding, swming, screeching, moaning, squirming, flowing, wrangling, crawling, shining, blushing, glowing,

Praised be the living!
