We grow up  
our worlds bigger with every step  
faster with every second  
more complex with every bit of knowledge  
We learn that we are  
That time exists  
That there is such a thing as distance

We climb the ladder  
Achieving, proud of ourselves  
Products of the efforts of others  
We grow up  
slowly learning what we need  
is unlearning
