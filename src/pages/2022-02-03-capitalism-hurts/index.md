Capitalism Hurts

The ignorant exploitation of others in the name of inifinite growth.

Inequality, covered up by lies about everyone getting the same chances. Inequality, to make sure there are enough slaves to the system. Everyone needs to cheat on themselves to survive.

With greed as the motor, the constant feeling of scarcity, that we pass on from one generation to the next.

Because we have to work so hard we lack the energy to give our children the love they need to withstand the toxic filth that the so-called free market vomits out over our youth.

Capitalism hurts

The sheer talk on progress is a stupid lie we have to tell ourselves to keep from laying awake at night. Because where did we progress to?

Was the destruction of the seasons worth the trip to Mars?

Are the superjachts worth the ecocide?

Our prolonged lifespans the trillions of suffering and murdered creatures we kill each year to sustain?

Are our nanotransistors worth the feeling of disgust that we feel when we think about what we did?

Capitalism hurts.
